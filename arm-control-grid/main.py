"""Gaze-selected pick with a Viam arm.

Laptop webcam -> gaze point on the RealSense feed window -> soft-targeted dwell
on a YOLO box locks that object (frozen snapshot of the exact image the boxes
came from) -> while the arm is still: two agreeing 3D segmentations, the object whose
center projects into the locked box is chosen, and it and every other object
are frozen into world coordinates -> sanity checks -> the motion service moves
the gripper above it, opens, descends in a straight line, closes, lifts, and
carries it back level.

SAFETY: the arm moves ONLY with --execute. Without it everything runs (camera,
YOLO, gaze, lock, 3D segmentation, transforms, checks) and the poses are
printed, but no motion or gripper command is sent. Q cancels the grasp and
sends arm.stop(), best effort; the physical E-STOP is the real stop.

Demo mode (the default) has exactly two gaze actions:
  1. Look at an object and hold: the arm picks it up and carries it back to
     the observe pose, still holding it, so the camera sees the table again.
  2. While holding, look at a DIFFERENT object and hold: the arm puts the held
     one back down where it came from, then picks up the new one.
  3. While holding, look at an EMPTY spot on the table and hold: the arm moves
     over that spot (new x, y), sets the object down there and lets go.
The new object is located (and every object frozen into world coordinates)
before anything moves; the put-back spot is then treated as an obstacle.

--menu instead shows a big gaze menu after the pick (delivery.py): bring it
to the user, raise/lower/closer/away, put it back, place it down or where the
user looks, let go, or (--user head, which implies --menu) steer it with head
motion (head_control.py).

Keys: Q stop+quit, R release the lock once the grasp attempt has finished, C recalibrate,
P (demo mode, operator) put the held object back without picking another.
Flags: --execute (allow motion), --menu, --user eyes|head, --skip-calibration (reuse
the last calibration), --quick-calibration (straight-head stage only), --detector NAME,
--set-home, --set-serve (record where objects are brought to the user).
--go-home-on-start (opt in to moving to the saved pose at launch).
--finger-clearance-mm N (override measured fingertip-to-body space),
--max-finger-extension-mm N (longest body-to-tip extension over the jaw stroke),
--gripper-body-from-flange-mm N (fixed flange-to-body-underside distance),
--grasp-z-offset-mm N (additional upward offset).
--object-width-mm LABEL=MM (explicit measured width for this label in this run).
